## Instructions

### 1. Introduction

The project consists of two parts:

-   A simulation exercise.
-   Basic inferential data analysis.

You will create a report to answer the questions. Given the nature of
the series, ideally you’ll use knitr to create the reports and convert
to a pdf. (I will post a very simple introduction to knitr). However,
feel free to use whatever software that you would like to create your
pdf.

Each pdf report should be no more than 3 pages with 3 pages of
supporting appendix material if needed (code, figures, etcetera).

### 2. Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructions

Now in the second portion of the project, we’re going to analyze the
ToothGrowth data in the R datasets package.

-   Load the ToothGrowth data and perform some basic exploratory data
    analyses
-   Provide a basic summary of the data.
-   Use confidence intervals and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth
    growth by supp and dose. (Only use the techniques from class, even
    if there’s other approaches worth considering)
-   State your conclusions and the assumptions needed for your
    conclusions.

### 3. Review Criteria

-   Did you show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to
    the theoretical center of the distribution?
-   Did you show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical
    variance of the distribution?
-   Did you perform an exploratory data analysis of at least a single
    plot or table highlighting basic features of the data?
-   Did the student perform some relevant confidence intervals and/or
    tests?
-   Were the results of the tests and/or intervals interpreted in the
    context of the problem correctly?
-   Did the student describe the assumptions needed for their
    conclusions?

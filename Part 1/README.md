# Part 1: Simulation Exercise

## Synopsis

Part 1 of the Course Project aims to show an understanding of the
central limit theorem (CLT), comparing simulation results with
theoretical expectations. The activity is based on a sample of 1,000
means generated by 40 numbers (with an exponential distribution profile
with lambda 0.2). Then comparing those values (the sample and
theoretical) to prove the CLT. As a result, a graph was plotted showing
the normality of the sample‚Äôs average, confirming the CLT.

## 1. Objectives

-   Task 1: Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean
    of the distribution.
-   Task 2: Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare
    it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
-   Task 3: Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

## 2. Requeriments and Settings

Please find the Requirements and Settings to reproduce this experiment
in the APPENDIX section or Forking the [Github
Repository](https://github.com/AndersonUyekita/statistical-inference_course-project/tree/main/Part%201).

## 3. Parameters

According to Part 1 of the Course Project, the parameters of this
assignment should be:

``` r
# Parameters
simulations <- 1000; sample_size <- 40; lambda <- 0.2
```

## 4. Simulations

Generating random data to create a dataset to answer the tasks posted on
‚Äú1. Objectives‚Äù.

``` r
# Adapting the source code given in the instructions.
mean_sample_exponential <- c()
for (i in 1 : 1000) {
    mean_sample_exponential = c(mean_sample_exponential,
                                base::mean(stats::rexp(n = 40, rate = 0.2)))
}
```

The `mean_sample_exponential` is a vector, 1000 in length, representing
the mean of each simulation of 40 samples.

## 5. Results

Please find below the answer to each question of the exponential
function dataset.

### 5.1. Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean

> Task 1: Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of
> the distribution.

**Theoretical Mean**: The Theoretical mean of an exponential
distribution is the inverse of lambda.

``` r
# Calculating the Theoretical Mean.
theoretical_mean <- 1 / lambda
```

So in this exercise, the theoretical mean is 5.

**Sample Mean**: The sample mean is shown below.

``` r
# Calculating the Sample Mean of each simulation.
sample_mean <- mean(mean_sample_exponential)
```

Thus, the sample mean is 5.007542.

**Conclusions**

Based on the results above, those means are very close due to the
significant amount of samples and simulations. This exercise shows the
concepts of the Central Limit Theorem.

### 5.2. Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance

> Task 2: Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it
> to the theoretical variance of the distribution.

To calculate the variance is necessary one step before calculating the
standard deviation. Thus, this section is divided into 2 steps.

**Theoretical Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation is calculated
analytically.

``` r
# Using the formula to calculate Theoretical Standard Deviation
theoretical_sd <- (1/lambda)/(base::sqrt(sample_size))
```

So in this exercise, the theoretical standard deviation is 0.7905694.

**Sample Standard Deviation**: The sample standard deviation is shown
below

``` r
# Using the sample to calculate the empirical value.
sample_sd <- stats::sd(mean_sample_exponential)
```

The sample standard deviation is 0.774678.

Using the standard deviation calculated above. It is possible to
calculate the variances.

**Theoretical Variance**: The Variance is the square of the standard
deviation

``` r
# Calculating the Theoretical variance.
theoretical_varicane <- theoretical_sd^2
```

So in this exercise the theorical variance is 0.625.

**Sample Variance**:

``` r
# Calculating the sample variance.
sample_variance <- stats::sd(mean_sample_exponential)^2
```

The sample variance is 0.6001259.

**Conclusions**

Based on the results above, those variances are very close due to the
significant amount of samples and simulations. This exercise shows the
concepts of the Central Limit Theorem.

### 5.3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal

> Task 3: Show that the distribution is approximately normal.

This question will be quickly answered using a graph.

![Comparison between Theoretical and Simulation outcomes. Graph Source
Code in Appendix.](README_files/figure-gfm/is_normal-1.png)

**Conclusions**

The histogram from the mean of 1000 simulations has proved the so-called
bell curve, which we could understand as a normal distribution. To
ensure this understanding, I have plotted two lines, the red one is the
simulation, and the blue one is the theoretical density curve (normal).
From the results of this graph, the behavior of the Central Limit
Theorem is clear.

## Central Limit Theorem Exercise & Guinea Pigs Tooth Growth Analysis

## Synopsis

Part 1 of the Course Project aims to show an understanding of the
central limit theorem (CLT), comparing simulation results with
theoretical expectations. The activity is based on a sample of 1,000
means generated by 40 numbers (with an exponential distribution profile
with lambda 0.2). Then comparing those values (the sample and
theoretical) to prove the CLT. As a result, a graph was plotted showing
the normality of the sample’s average, confirming the CLT.

Part 2 of the Course Project aims to analyze the ToothGrowth database
using confidence intervals and tests. This dataset has 60 observations
on 3 (three) variables and describes the tooth growth in guinea pigs in
respect of a vitamin C supplement by two delivery methods. According to
the results, it is possible to identify there is no evidence to affirm
Orange Juice (OJ) and Ascorbic Acid (VC) have different performance
outcomes. However, there is strong evidence that increasing the vitamin
C dosage increases tooth growth.

## 1. Introduction

> Course Project consists of 2 (two) parts:
>
> -   A simulation exercise, and;
> -   Basic inferential data analysis.
>
> You will create a report to answer the questions. Given the nature of
> the series, ideally you’ll use knitr to create the reports and convert
> to a pdf. (I will post a very simple introduction to knitr). However,
> feel free to use whatever software that you would like to create your
> pdf.
>
> Each pdf report should be no more than 3 pages with 3 pages of
> supporting appendix material if needed (code, figures, etcetera).
